# GPU-Challenges
A bunch of Leet-code style challenges to practice GPU programming (Mainly Cuda for now)

- All the code in the challenges is written by hand, with some IDE auto-completions (No LLMs) in an attempt to actually become good at CUDA
- All docstrings are LLM-generated after directing it to explain the problems, and highlight any specific optimization techniques, if any.
